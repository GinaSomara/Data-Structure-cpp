# Data Structure cpp

Linked List project. * The c-make file will need to be changed if downloaded, depending on what the name of the project name is in the used IDE. 


!! The skeleton code of this is used from the below Pearson Education. However, I did all implementations/routing of the C++ files. The skeleton code merely gave the empty functions and empty classes to begin with. Everything was coded and linked by me !!
